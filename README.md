# Open Optimal Control Library

## Introduction

The Open Optimal Control Library is a toolbox in Matlab for facilitating modelling and formulation of (parametric) optimal control problems. Interfaces casadi and ipopt.

## Quick start

Visit the wiki page for a guide, and have a look the examples:    
https://github.com/JonasKoenemann/optimal-control/wiki

## Models

* airborne wind energy: https://openawe.github.io/
* robotics: https://github.com/JonasKoenemann/openocl_models (very experimental)
